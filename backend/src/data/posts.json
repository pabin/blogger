JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it executes one task at a time. However, with asynchronous programming, we can handle multiple operations without blocking the main thread.\\n\\nThe traditional way to handle asynchronous tasks is through callbacks, but they often lead to callback hell, making code difficult to read and maintain. Promises were introduced to solve this issue, providing a cleaner syntax and better error handling. A promise represents a value that may be available now, later, or never. With .then() and .catch(), we can chain operations for better readability.\\n\\nThe most modern approach is Async/Await, which allows us to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. Using async functions and the await keyword, we can simplify promise handling, making code easier to understand. However, proper error handling using try...catch is still necessary.\\n\\nMastering these concepts is crucial for working with APIs, databases, and real-time applications. By understanding callbacks, promises, and async/await, developers can write more efficient and maintainable JavaScript code.","tagsmapped":["JavaScript"," Async Programming"," Promises"],"id":"b8331480-52c6-4337-8654-8cc25caeb1e5","date":"2025-03-15T16:22:04.716Z","bookmarked":true},{"title":"Understanding React's Virtual DOM updated","content":"React's Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that allows updates to be processed efficiently.
